What is python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","  -> Python is high level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. It is popular because of its simple syntax, readability, large community support, and vast collection of libraries for data science, web development, automation and AI.\n","\n","2. What is an interpreter in pyhton?\n","\n","  -> An interpreter executes Pthyon code line by line, converting it into machine code at runtime. This make debugging simple but can be slower compared to compiled languages.\n","\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","  -> keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings, and cannot be used as variable names. Examples: if , else, while, for, true, false, none.\n","  \n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n"," -> No. keywords are reserved and cannot be used as variable names.\n","    EXAMPLE:  \n","    "],"metadata":{"id":"4hvNfMIoMpce"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"k01LOBvlL3j_","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":106},"executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1757920936625,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":25,"user":{"displayName":"Gaurav Parasher","userId":"04869662047730499062"}},"outputId":"f5175bdd-562d-45b4-edcb-3075820b35a9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"SyntaxError","evalue":"invalid syntax (ipython-input-2602365234.py, line 1)","traceback":["\u001b[0;36m  File \u001b[0;32m\"/tmp/ipython-input-2602365234.py\"\u001b[0;36m, line \u001b[0;32m1\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31m    if = 20\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m       ^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;31mSyntaxError\u001b[0m\u001b[0;31m:\u001b[0m invalid syntax\n"]}],"source":["if = 20\n","#"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[" 5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n"," -> Mutability means whether an object can be changed after creation. Mutable objectts can be modified( list, dictionaries), imumutable are objects cannot( tuples, strings).\n","\n"," 6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","  \n","  -> list are mutable so elements can be added, removed, or modified.\n","\n","  -> tuples are immutable to ensure data integrity and allow them to be used as dictonary keys or set elements.\n","\n","  7.

What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","-> Implicit(type conversion) - Python automatically converts one type to another. ex- 3 + 4.5 = 7.5\n"," .Explicit(type casting) - programmer explicitly converts type using functions like int(), floot(), str().\n","  \n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n"," -> They allow decision-making in programs by executing different code blocks based on condition. ex- if, elif, else.\n","\n"," 12. How does the elif statement work?\n","\n"," -> it allows multiple conditions to be checked one after another. Once a conditio is true, the corresponding block executes, and the rest are skipped.\n","\n"," 13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","  \n","  -> for loop - used when the number of iteration is known (iterates over sequencs).\n","  . while loop - used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a conditon.\n","\n","  14.
